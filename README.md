# vim-config

## Vim configuration files, skeleton files, and setup scripts.

The setup scripts in this repository automate the installation of the Vim text editor and configures it to certain personal preferences. The included files are automatically downloaded by the setup script and their directories are created if non-existent. The goal of this configuration is to steamline Vim for writing code. This is achieved through various plugins, global settings, global key mappings, file specific settings, and file specific key mappings. As my understanding of Vim and different programming languages evolve, so will these setup scripts.
